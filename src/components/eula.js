                        This Agreement entitles you to install and use one copy of the Software Product. In addition, you may make one
                        archival copy of the Software Product. The archival copy must be on a storage medium other than a hard drive,
                        and may only be used for the reinstallation of the Software Product. This Agreement does not permit the installation
                        or use of multiple copies of the Software Product, or the installation of the Software Product on more than one
                        computer at any given time, on a system that allows shared used of applications, on a multi-user network, or on
                        any configuration or system of computers that allows multiple users. Multiple copy use or installation is only
                        allowed if you obtain an appropriate licensing agreement for each user and each copy of the Software Product.
